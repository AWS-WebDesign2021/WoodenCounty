<!-- This area is the main body text, specifically discussing AI weaponry -->
    <div class="mainrow">
      Artificial intelligence is becoming far more common in many fields, but an
      unlikely one that has a significant moral impact is its rising use in the
      military. Autonomous and AI enabled weapons are at the center of this discussion,
       which many countries are actively developing without a clear understanding
       of what this means for the future. China, the United States, and other nations
        have fully functional autonomous systems that can define a target and lock
         onto it. Currently there is a human required to oversee all lethal
         semi-automated weapons, they require a person “in-the-loop,” but as
         these weapons are developing quickly and being sold around the world
         without clear rules, who knows how long lethal automated weapons will
         require a human to make such a terminal desiscon. The true concern with
         all of this is the lack of clear guidelines, as this is such new technology.
          Conferences and discussions have happened, but no laws have been defined,
          different nations have created different definitions of what an AI weapon
           means, letting them each decide which weapons are allowed and which are
           not. Who knows what steps a desperate nation will take during, “The fog
           of war.” As Professor Peter Asaro said, “It's important to realize that
           targeting a weapon is an act -- a moral act, choosing to pull the trigger,
            to engage that weapon, is another moral act. These are two crucial acts
            that we should not have become fully autonomous.”
