    From ancient times, artificial intelligence has manifested itself in the forms of autonomous war machines, robotic servants, and even autonomous musicians. Now so, it takes the form of blood analyzing machines, self-driving cars, and the infamous human-cloned robots. AI, artificial intelligence, is defined by global tech corporation, International Business Machine, as “any human-like intelligence exhibited by a computer, robot, or other machine.” This understanding of AI really took off in the 1950’s after a report, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, by Alan Turing highlighted the inner workings of computer technology by tackling the question: can a machine think? In the following decades, machines would beat the best humans of their fields in calculation-based games including Go and Chess. Carrying through the rest of the 20th century, companies and startups continue to develop computer intelligence in every area of life: medicine, entertainment, infrastructure, etc. Today, there certainly is no sign of stopping the growth and presence of artificial intelligence in our everyday lives.
