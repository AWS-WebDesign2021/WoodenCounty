    <td><p> Megan Thee Stallion is
easily one of my favorite rap artists and artists in general. While reaching the
first of many peaks in her music career, she was enrolled at Texas Southern
University studying health administration and has just recently graduated.
With her boldly sexual lyrics, Megan continues to beath the path for Black women
in the grossly sexist rap game, making it seem effortless with her kind and gentle
demeanor. Her 2020 album, Suga, immediately topped charts,
making it her second major ablum after her 2018, Fever (rightfully so). I love her
because she is open about being both a nerd and loving to shake her ass!! Too often,
young women are made to think we have can't have both. She is so beautiful and so
talented. One of my avorite songs on the album is <i>Ain't Equal.</i>
