    <td><p>At just 19 years old, Flo Milli has shot to the charts as both a
promising and delivering artist. Her honest and unappologetic lyrics dance over
her rythmic flows;
they are absolutely delicious. Flo's start in 2019 was immediate after the release
of her first song, Beef FloMix, captivating young listeners everywhere. She is
certainly comfortable steppin on some toes with her musicâ€“ good for her.
I especially love her totally cool word plays and ridicously catchy beats. On her
debut album, "Ho, why is you here ?", <i>May I</i> is so so groovy.</p></td>
