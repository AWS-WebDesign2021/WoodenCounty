In this recollection of the dream, I'm running around the pavillion of my old
Catholic school. It's daytime, it's empty, and there are two maybe three big,
muscular black Dogs chasing me. Their fur is so black it's shiny. When I reach
the front doors, they're locked and the Dogs catch up to me and bite only my
hands. I can feel my hands experiencing sharp tingles as I stand facing the
locked doors. Oh well, I suppose I could turn around and face the Dogs. We'll
become friends.
