    <td><p>Nicki Minaj is undoubtedly one of the most influential rap artists of
  our time. She has shaped the rap industry not just for her femme successors but for
  the entire male-dominated game. She's collaberated with many artists, printing
  lively songs with her unique, deadly, and melodic flow. Her discography is as
  extensive and diverse as her fashion sense. After internal debate, I chose
  Nicki's 2011 "Pink Friday...Roman Reloaded", simply because it contains the most
  bangers reminding me of my younger years. One such banger being the classic
  <i>Starships.</i></p></td>
