      <u>History</u>
      <p>What is known today as Washington State has been home to many peoples
        long before written record. Prior to the early 1800s, the
        demographics were comprised of native communites. The 1830s brought
        foreigners from Europe in search of work, aboundance, and opportunity
        amidst the region's plentiful forests and natural resources.
        <br><br>
        Places like Tacoma and Aberdeen served as international hubs for the
        global timber economy, while the entire Pacific coast bursted with ports
        for seafood and fishing industries worldwide.
        <br><br>
        Today, is no different; people from all over the world immigrate and
        visit Washington to experience Her forest and natural wonders and unique
        environments. While comprised of people from all over the world,
        Washington is still home to the Duwamish, Quinault, Yakima, Wanapum,
        Suquamish, Steilacoom, Squaxin, Palouse, and many more Native communites.
        <br><br>
        Since early colonization, Native-foreigner relations have
        led to wars, battles, oppressive systems, and exploitative and genocidal
        governments today. Irregardless, Resistance and freedom movements are
        alive and well.
