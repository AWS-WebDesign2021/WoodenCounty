  <p>
Whether you live in one of Seattle's highest skyrises, one of Wenatchee's
densest forests, or a cozy neighborhood in between, the state of the natural
environment affects you. Living in a world with basic ecological knowledge will
benefit you. Unfortunately European colonization did a number in destorying much
of the history, evidence, and knowledge about the Natural world and humans' role
in it. Nonetheless, Indigenous wisdom and mindsets of reciprocity have proven
their resilince. So now, we have the responsibility of honoring that wisdom and
paying homage to the People who have fostered trust and relationships with the
land we live on and organisms we live with.

From the seemingly common Crow overhead or the types of trees planted in your yard,
all of the funky organisms– including the one reading this right now– are
working together through the big game of Life through a series of precious Engergy
transfers. As you read this, death and birth are happening from the micro level
to the macro level. Learning about the small ways in which you impact these
Engergy transfers can have a huge affect on their outcomes. Today, many of us
humans have been all too comfortable in out negligence to our roles, impacts,
and responsibilities to the reciprocal relationships that sustain our Home
Planet. This is actively leading to the demise of the human race, and, more
unfortunately because of their lack of say in the matter, the extinction of
fellow animals.

      Because of the global indoctrination of white supremacy and capitalism,
      our planet is experiencing irreparable damage for the duration of human
      existence. Knowlege guiding our actions is the only way to address the
      otherwise inevitable doom to humans– rich, poor, big, small, funny,
      not-funny– all of us. Luckily we have flow master, Lil Dicky, to raise both
      awareness and our spirits on the issue.
